# About the Project 

- I used the [cocktaildb api](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) to get data about the different cocktails, recipies, and more information
- I made this project using Nextjs 
- There should be a light and dark mode, but you only view the version that your theme is set to on your laptop
